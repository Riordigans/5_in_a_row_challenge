README

To run the game, start one instance of server and two instances of client.
This can be accomplished by running the files in an IDE/text editor or by using

	javac Server.java
	java Server

in the command line on a machine with the Java JDK installed.

Test files are stored in the same package as the program files.
There are three test files, GameTest.java, ClientTest.java and ServerTest.java.

Some parts of the Client and Server are not fully covered by tests, however they are both fully functional and robust.

Thank you for this opportunity and I hope you like the game :)
